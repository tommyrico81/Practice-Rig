# R4 Street CE - Project 399 Practice Rig
The R4 Street Practice Rig takes the already bullet proof Project 399 Practice Rig Frame, and retrofits it into a DRL Style Racer 4 Canopy. This modification requires only the 2 halfplates (3mm each), and 4 arms (6mm each). There is an example of the frame build on this site showing the configuration of the carbon. If you choose to take your existing practice rig and use it in this configuration, you will require the 3D printed pieces for assembly. Please note that there are a few options depending on the setup you are using. Select the appropriate Camera Cradle for the HD DJI AirUnit or Analog Camera System. The Analog camera has been tested to fit a RunCam Racer or Microswift. The bottom shell also has two options, a 5s 1800mah battery or 5s 2200mah battery. Currently 2200mah 5s batteries are available from various online FPV stores. The 2200mah bottom canopy was designed around the Pyrodrone 2200mah 5s pack. Since the Pyrodrone Pack is slightly larger than the RDQ or CNHL Battery, these should fit as well in the battery cavity.

# Recommended Build

HD DJI Build - https://rotorbuilds.com/build/21813

2408/2507/2510 sized motors, in 1300kv

The reason for the lower KV is to force you to learn race lines. If you're always using extra power as a crutch to fly, you wont ever learn the fast way around the track. Having a slower heavier quad forces you to keep your momentum and practice good race lines. 

5s 2200mah or 2x 1300mah packs in parallel

The larger battery helps you get as much flight time as possible. You can now full throttle for 5 minutes straight. Squeezing the most practice time out of your time at the field.

7" props

Helps get those longer flight times, also thats what we race on DRL with the R4. HQ 7x4x3 are currently the only prop that is reccomended for this build

FC and 4:1 ESC

Any reliable stack will work, The Hobbywing G3 60a ESC and FC combo is highly reccomended
